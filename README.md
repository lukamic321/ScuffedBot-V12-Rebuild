# ScuffedBot Rebuild

Welcome to ScuffedBot, a general purpose utility bot created by lukamic#6139. This bot adds the commands like userinfo, serverinfo, ping, etc. The bot also features commands such as 'Private', which adds the ability to create invisible invite-only voice channels for you and your friends. This repo is for a rebuild of the bot that I'm creating with the hope of speeding it up and taking some weight off my computers shoulders.

## Adding ScuffedBot to your discord server

ScuffedBot is currently in development, so I've hidden the invite link for security reasons. If you wish to add ScuffedBot Beta to your server, and are aware of the risks such action incurs, please contact me via the discord handle found on my GitHub account readme

If you'd like to help develope the bot, please feel free to contact me at my discord handle above. This bot is mainly an on again/off again passion project of mine, so anyone with more experience than me is welcome.
