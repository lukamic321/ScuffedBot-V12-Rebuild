  "description": "Welcome to ScuffedBot, a general purpose utility bot created by lukamic#6139. This bot adds the commands like userinfo, serverinfo, ping, etc. The bot also features commands such as 'Private', which adds the ability to create invisible invite-only voice channels for you and your friends. This repo is for a rebuild of the bot that I'm creating with the hope of speeding it up and taking some weight off my computers shoulders.",
